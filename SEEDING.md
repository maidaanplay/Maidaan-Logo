# Database Seeding Guide

This guide will help you seed your Supabase database with test data including an admin user, venue, courts, and player accounts.

## Prerequisites

1. Supabase project is set up
2. Database schema has been run (see `SETUP.md`)
3. Environment variables are configured

## Steps

### 1. Get Your Service Role Key

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
3. Copy the **service_role** key (‚ö†Ô∏è Keep this secret!)

### 2. Add Service Role Key to .env.local

Open `.env.local` and add your service role key:

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...your_actual_key
```

### 3. Run the Schema (First Time Only)

If you haven't already, run the database schema:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard > **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Click **Run** to create all tables and policies

### 4. Run the Seed Script

```bash
npm run seed
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Error creating admin user: User already registered"
The admin user already exists. You can either:
- Skip the admin creation
- Delete the user from Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
- Use a different email in the seed script

### "Missing service role key"
Make sure you've added `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to your `.env.local` file.

### "Error creating venue: permission denied"
Make sure:
1. The database schema has been run
2. RLS policies are set up correctly
3. The service role key is correct

## Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** The service role key bypasses Row Level Security. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code. It should only be used in secure server-side scripts.
